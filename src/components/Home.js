          I’m an expert in my field but I wouldn’t be where I am without those
          who've helped me along the way. That’s why I love connecting with
          like-minded people and using my passion and skills to make a
          difference.

          I am a P.h.D. in Animal Science specialized in animal nutrition and
          quality of feed materials. In 2020 I got a fantastic opportunity to
          join a web development training and as a result, it enabled me to add
          programming skills to my researcher's toolkit. Please, join me in my
          journey of making animal feed a better more balanced remedy for caring
          for our four-legged friends as well as helping our planet to have it
          easier with us humans living on her surface.
